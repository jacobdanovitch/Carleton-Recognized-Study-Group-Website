# COMP1406 Recognized Study Group

This repo holds a very basic website for a recurring computer science study group. This group, led by [Tim Elliott](https://github.com/TimJElliott) and I as volunteers, meets weekly to help our classmates do as well as possible.

This site is intended to be extremely minimalistic. At some point I will attempt to make it much more aesthetically pleasing, but for now, it does what it needs to do: a Carleton student can sign-up, check-in for our study sessions, and keep track of how many they've been to for their co-curricular credit.
